My most complete project so far is the [music translate addon for Anki](https://github.com/Cristinasj/musicTranslateAddon)
I've also done some [web scrapping that got me into trouble](https://github.com/Cristinasj/SWADhacks)
Long time ago I tried to make a [shopping manager](https://github.com/Cristinasj/shoppingManager) but the project is stopped at the moment 
Finally, I have another small project waiting to be finished to see the light and go public
